It is also a time-saving app, as it allows to see the whole picture not to bothering much. 
It was a good practice in istalling and using Node.js and npm packages. Using Jest packages it was possible to make sure every provided test wass passed. And this made the code work.

To get started with this command-line application user has to be familiar with Node.js. After typing "node + the name of the file" command in the terminal the user will get questions to answer one by one.
